 This code is a program to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. We were  tasked with building a prototype dashboard. We want to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the San Francisco market. If the new service is popular, then we can start to expand to other markets.

The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.
